    ### What am I?         
    Ever felt overwhelmed by UML diagrams? I hear you! That's why I'm here! 
             With the brainpower of GPT-4 Turbo, I turn the complex into the comprehensible.

    Here's what I can do:
             
    - **Use Case Diagram & Descriptions**
    - **Class Diagram**
    - **Component Diagram**
             
    I not only create the diagrams, but I also explain the reasoning behind them - so that students (like my creators) can finally understand what's going on.

    ### Why do I exist?
    My creators were in your shoes. They had awesome ideas but diagramming felt like a chore. They thought "There's gotta be a better way!" so 
             they then put their heads together and sparked me to life. 

    With me, you get to focus on the real deal - crafting killer software. Great ideas shouldn't be bogged down by diagramming, so let me streamline the process. 

    ### Who created me?
    Alex.AI is developed by a dedicated team of four undergraduates passionate in AI and Software Engineering.
